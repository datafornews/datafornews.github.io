# Why Data For News

**Going beyond a simple news article.** A news article is written at a certain place, by people and a precise moment. It is a whole within a context often hard to grasp alone.

That's why Data For News aims to gather a community of developers, designers, data scientists and journalists to develop tools that will help us to **better understand information**.

While we have already started some projects and have ideas for others, we also want this community to be the place for *your* project. **Together** we will start off new means to digest news and information wisely by enriching existing ones.

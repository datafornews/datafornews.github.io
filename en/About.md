# Why Data For News

**Going beyond a simple news article.** A news article is written at a certain place, by people and a precise moment. It is a whole within a context often hard to grasp alone.

That's why Data For News aims to gather a community of developers, designers, data scientists and journalists to develop tools that will help us to **better understand information**.

If we already started some projects, or have ideas of others, we want this community to also be the place to develop *your* project. **Together** we will start off new means to digest news and information wisely by enriching existing ones.
